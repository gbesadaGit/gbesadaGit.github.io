Hey there! My name is Gabriel, and this is my personal webpage. My published work and contact information will all be consolidated here!

I received my Bachelor Degree from Carnegie Mellon University, where I developed my skills in Software Engineering and Japanese Translation. I hope to prove that a well rounded education experience does not mean that I lack expertise in my passions.

I'm working towards building my portfolio on both the translation and software end, and the results of those efforts should be showing up here sometime soon!

Education
